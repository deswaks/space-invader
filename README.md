The tools has been created as a project at the Technical University of Denmark, August 2019.

3. Paste the files into the Grasshopper User Objects Folder (optionally create a subfolder for the files).

# How to use
The tools of this package are not finished programs in themselves. They provide functions that are useful for location and reconstruction of analytical building spaces.

For instructions on how to use each component, refer to the documentation supplied in the file <i>documentation.pdf</i>

# Example
The file <i>example_distance_fields_ordered_points.gh</i> is a complete program that makes use of the majority of the functions and can locate and recreate rooms in 2D building models. For further examples on how to use all the functions, see the program files in the <i>program</i> folder in which we have made use of the rest of the tools.
